# Flappy Bird
I wrote all this code as a content creator for a company that runs free coding courses for highschool aged students. Our teaching model separates the students into rooms of their ability level and then they all complete the same project. This is so that everyone is in a place where they can learn free from judgement. Without feeling dissappointed or left out due to their final project. The extensions are in case a student is very ahead. 

_Notice: The naming of the files is due to the workbooks I created for this so don't really expect them to make sense._
